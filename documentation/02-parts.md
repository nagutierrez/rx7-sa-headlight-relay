The following parts were chosen for this project

| Part #         | Qty | Description       | Manufacturer       |
| -------------- | --- | ----------------- | ------------------ |
| 19705-4001     | 5   | Male Tab Terminal | Molex              |
| G8N-1L-AS DC12 | 1   | Relay             | Omron              |
| 1N5819         | 3   | Schottky Diodes   | STMicroelectronics |

## Tab Terminals

These terminals were the right dimensions to work with the original connector and could be mounted directly onto the PCB.

## Relay

The omron relay was chosen for its compact size, high current capacity, and availability. It was designed specifically for use with DC motors in automotive applications.

## Diodes

The 1N5819 Schottky diodes were chosen for their low forward voltage drop and high current capacity. Their quick response time make them a good choice for flyback diodes, while their current capacity is will ensure that they are not ruined by the current draw of the indication light.
